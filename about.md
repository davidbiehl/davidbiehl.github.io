Like most people, there are many facets to my life and I can't be absolutely
defined by any single one. So here is a breif description of the particularly
important or interesting facets (in no particular order).

### Family

I would like to maintain at least some privacy, so the victims shall remain
nameless. My lovely wife and I have four children together: three boys and one
girl in that order. While it can get crazy at times, I love my family to pieces
and am really happy to have them around.

### Work

I manage the IT department for North Coast Medical. Despite being a manager, I
still spend a lot of time writing Ruby, configuring Linux servers and keeping
the lights on.

### Technology

I started writing BASIC code when I was 8 years old and studied programming
through most of high school. During college I studied audio production thinking
I would operate a recording studio someday. That someday never came, but I still
love technology and writing software.

### Religion

I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, aka. the
Mormon Church. I served a mission for the church in South Korea for 2 years.
Yes, I even learned to read, write and speak Korean which is an awesome
language.

### Health

Health has always been interesting to me. I'm not that healthy, and I'm starting
to feel it now that I'm in my 30's. Continual improvement is something I value,
and I think that health may be the next area of my life that I need to improve.
I'll keep you posted.
